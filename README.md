Foundations Project: Rock Paper Scissors

live demo: https://dannymaclaughlin.github.io/FoundationsRockPaperScissors/

Play against the computer in a game of rock, paper, scissors as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This is my first project in which I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript together. 

What I have benefited from completing this project:

- Gained a deeper understanding of Javascript functions
- Put to practice and gained experience using DOM manipulation and event listeners
